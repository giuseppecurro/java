ERRORE FREQUENTISSIMO:

Why a non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context ?
======================================================================
When you try to access a non­static variable from a static context like main method, java compiler throws a message like "a non­static variable cannot
be referenced from a static context". This is because non­static variables are related with instance of class(object) and they get created when instance
of a class is created by using new operator. So if you try to access a non­static variable without any instance compiler will complain because those
variables are not yet created and they don't have any existence until an instance is created and associated with it.
Example of accessing non­static variable from a static context
class Test 
{ 
 int x; 
 public static void main(String[] args) 
 { 
  x=10; 
 } 
} 
Output
compiler error: non­static variable count cannot be referenced from a static context

===============
Same example using instance of class
class Test 
{ 
 int x; 
 public static void main(String[] args) 
 { 
  Test tt=new Test(); 
  tt.x=10;  //works fine with instance of class 
 } 
}
